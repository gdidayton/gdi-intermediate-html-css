      ### So what's so cool about HTML5?

      There is far too much to cover in our time together

      ## Marks some old things obsolete
      **Examples**

      - Deprecated items (e.g. `frame, frameset, noframes`)
      - Presentational elements and attributes replaced by CSS (e.g. `font, big, center`)

      ## HTML5 Doctype

      ```html
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      ```

      Minimum information required to ensure that a browser renders using standards mode

    notes: |
      The `doctype` is a required piece at the top of an HTML file. That little line tells the browser how to treat this HTML file&mdash;what sort of content to expect.

      ## Old Doctypes

      ```html
      <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"
      "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">

      <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
      "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
      ```
    notes: |
      This is a welcome change for long-time web developers as the old doctypes were…more substantial.

    content: |
      ## `<section>`
      <hr><br>

      ## `<header>`
      <hr><br>

      - Container for a group of introductory or navigational aids

      - Usually a list of links

      - E.g. site navigation


  -
    content: |
      ## `<footer>`
      <hr><br>

      - Contains information about its containing element
      - E.g. who wrote it, copyright, links to related content, etc.
      - Document can have multiple footer elements
      - E.g. one for the page, one for each section


  -
