      ### Workshop files

      Last reminder to download the files for today's class! </p>

      - We have provided a folder that contains sample images for you to use today. We encourage you to be creative so don't feel like you're restricted to these images

      - We've also included a blank index.html file for you to work from, as well as the final site for you to use as a reference if you get stuck.
