      ### Why three columns?

      Columns and grid layout is a common pattern<br>in web design that spans many site types.

      Our code should look something like this:

      ```html
        <section id="main-content">
        <h3>...</h3>
        <section class="column">
        <img src="images/africa.png" alt="Africa">
        <h4>My Home</h4>
        <p>Wild zebras live in Africa.</p>
        <a href="home.html" class="btn">See my home</a>
        </section>
        <!-- Repeat .column x3 -->
        </section>
      ```

      Now that we have our 3 columns, we want them to appear next to each other. We can do this by floating them all left.

      ```css
      .column {
        float: left;
        width: 33.333%;
        padding: 1em;
      }
      ```

      We used 33.333%, because that is one third of 100%. Don’t forget padding (or margin) to give the columns some space.

      ### Wow. Large Images.

      Our responsive `max-width: 100%;` lets the image grow until it hits the edge of the container. In this case, we want the image to be a little bit smaller than the container.

      ```css
      .column img {
        width: 70%;
      }
      ```

      There we go!

      Let’s add a border radius to it too, because we ❤️ circles

      ```css
      .column img {
        width: 70%;
        border-radius: 50%;
        border: 0.3125em solid #5C4B82;
        margin-bottom: 1.25em;
      }
      ```

      <div>
      We’ve got our 3 column layout set, our images are scaled based on the width of the column, but our columns are still bumping against the edges of the browser.
      </div>
      <div>
      ```html
      <section id="main-content">
        <div class="container">
          <h3>...</h3>
          <section class="column">
          ...
          </section>
          <section class="column">
          ...
          </section>
          <section class="column">
          ...

      ```
