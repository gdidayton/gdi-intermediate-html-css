      ## SVG Graphics

      ## It’s not that new really

      It’s been a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard since 1999

      In recent years browsers are becoming more and more compatable with SVG graphics.

      Once upon a time, .png graphics weren’t supported in browsers, soon the world will know about SVG!

      ## How to use SVG today

      Use Adobe Illustrator, or other vector program, to create a high quality image.

      Save it as a .svg file.

      Save a high res .png image as a fallback.

      ## Include SVG

      Use SVG as an image:

      ```
      <img src="image.svg" onerror="this.onerror=null; this.src='image.png'">
      ```

      Use SVG as a background image:

      HTML: <!-- .element class="blue" -->

      ```html
      <a href="/" class="logo">
        GDI
      </a>
      ```

      CSS: <!-- .element class="blue" -->

      ```css
      .logo {
        display: block;
        color: transparent;
        width: 100px;
        height: 82px;
        background: url(kiwi.svg);
        background-size: 100px 82px;
      }
      ```

      ### SVG Social Icons

      Now that we know how awesome SVG graphics are, let’s use them in our social links section.

      ### Social Links: HTML

      ```html
      <section id="social">
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="..">
                <img src="images/facebook.svg" alt="Facebook" />
            </a>
          </li>
          <!-- Repeat for all social links you want to include -->
        </ul>
      </section>
      ```

      We’re using a list for these links for the exact same reason we used them in the navigation. They are a list of links, and should be marked up accordingly.

      ### Social Links: CSS

      We’ll need to add a background, some padding, account for the floated list items.

      ```css
      #social {
        background: #57BEC5;
        color: #fafafa;
        padding: 25px 0;
        overflow: hidden;
      }
      #social li {
        float: left;
        width: auto;
        padding: 20px;
      }
      ```

      ### Centering the List

      First we should put our social links in a container! We’ll also add in a headline.

      ```html
      <section id="social">
        <div class="container">
        <h3>...</h3>
        <ul>
          ...
        </ul>
        </div>
      </section>
      ```

      Next we’ll center the `ul` with a very [flexible technique](http://matthewjamestaylor.com/blog/beautiful-css-centered-menus-no-hacks-full-cross-browser-support) that will allow us to have a list of any width

      ### Develop It!

      - Style the headline using the Descendant Selector
      - If you have Illustrator or another program to modify .svg graphics, change the colors to match your site
