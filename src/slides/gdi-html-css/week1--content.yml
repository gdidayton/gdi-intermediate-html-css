      ### Why 3 columns?

      Because 2 columns is so 2013

      Or, because it's a comfortable width for readability. And because 3 is a pleasing design construct.

      ### 3 Column: HTML

      Our code should look something like this:

      ```html
        <section id="main-content">
        <h3>...</h3>
        <section class="column">
        <img src="images/africa.png" alt="Africa">
        <h4>My Home</h4>
        <p>Wild zebras live in Africa.</p>
        <a href="home.html" class="btn">See my home</a>
        </section>
        <!-- Repeat .column x3 -->
        </section>
      ```

      ### 3 Column: CSS

      Now that we have our 3 columns, we want them to appear next to each other. We can do this by floating them all left.

      ```css
      .column {
        float: left;
        width: 30%;
        padding: 15px;
      }
      ```

      We used 30%, because it lets us perfectly spaced columns without doing math! Don't forget padding (or margin) to give the columns some space.

      ### Wow. Large Images.

      The images didn't scale with the columns, because they ignore constraints like
          `div` width, unless you tell them to do so.

      ```css
      .column img {
        width: 90%;
        max-width: 90%;
      }
      ```
      There we go!

      Let's add a border radius to it too, because we &hearts; circles

      ```css
      .column img {
        width: 90%;
        max-width: 90%;
        border-radius: 50%;
      }
      ```

      ### 3 Column: Container

      We've got our 3 column layout set, our images are scaled based on the width of the column, but our columns are still bumping against the edges of the browser.

      ```html
      <section id="main-content">
      <div class="container">
      <h3>...</h3>
      <section class="column">
      ...
      </section>
      <section class="column">
      ...
      </section>
      <section class="column">
      ...
      </section>
      </div>
      </section>
      ```

      Adding the container, which we already defined the width of, makes everything line up.
